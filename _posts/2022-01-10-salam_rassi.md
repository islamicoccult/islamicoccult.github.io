Those familiar with the history of Arabic philosophy and science will know of the famous Baghdad "Translation Movement" of the eighth to tenth century. In this period, Christians and Sabians, together with Muslims, participated in the translation of Greek texts into Arabic.[^1] Far less understood, however, is how Muslims and non-Muslims continued to participate in shared modes of scientific production in later centuries. And while scholars have long recognised that many key figures in medieval Arabic philosophy (conventionally defined) were non-Muslims, few have acknowledged this multi-confessionalism in the occult sciences.


To find evidence of these encounters, one has only to look to the Arabic manuscript tradition. In addition to the Arabic script, there exist several occult scientific works written in Garshūnī, that is, Arabic written in Syriac letters. Roughly analogous to Judeo-Arabic, Garshūnī was frequently employed in Syriac Christian communities throughout history as a vehicle for liturgical and theological writing.[^2] However, Garshūnī was also used to write works of Arabic literature more generally, including those that might be considered "Islamic." 


One way of understanding these intersections is through the rubric of "Islamicate" culture, a coinage of the historian Marshall Hodson (1922--1968). In his ground-breaking *Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilisation*, "Islamicate" describes that which does "not refer to the religion, Islam, itself, but to the social and cultural complex historically associated with Islam and the Muslims, both among Muslims themselves and even when found among non-Muslims."[^3] Hodgson also speaks of a "lettered tradition ... naturally shared in by both Muslims and non-Muslims."[^4] This notion of a common "lettered tradition" is, I believe, a useful lens through which to study Christian involvement in the Arabic occult sciences. For it gives us sufficient scope to understand the ways in which Christians in Muslim-ruled lands participated in shared intellectual practices, while also constituting distinct confession identities.[^5]


A similarly useful framework comes from Sarah Stroumsa's recent book, *Andalus and Sefarad: On Philosophy and Its History in Islamic Spain*. In this study of Jewish intellectualism in al-Andalus, Stroumsa identifies Arabic as not only a language of prestige but also a transconfessional *koinē*—"a common cultural platform for thinkers of different religious and ethnic backgrounds". In effect, Arabic gave rise to a commonwealth of "texts, ideas, and concerns \[which\] were fully shared and discussed \[...\] by philosophers and scientists hailing from different religious communities."[^6] These ideas and concerns could attend to things as varied as medicine, the unity of God, debates about the divine attributes, and the question of the world's creation in time. However, as we shall now see, these shared intellectual concerns also extended to subjects like geomancy and alchemy.

## The Prophet Daniel and ṬumṬum the Indian in Garshūnī Geomantic Manuals

Several such works exist in ecclesiastical and monastic collections across modern-day Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, and Iraq. One repository is the Syrian Orthodox Church of the Forty Martyrs in Mardin, recently digitised by the Hill Museum & Manuscript Library (HMML).[^7] Here, we find two works of geomancy attributed to Ṭumṭum al-Hindī ("Ṭumṭum the Indian"), both written in Garshūnī.[^8] The origins of geomancy in the Islamic world are attributed to various legendary and quasi-legendary figures, the most common of whom are the archangel Gabriel and the prophet Idrīs. The latter is then said to have taught geomancy to the mysterious Ṭumṭum, an entirely legendary figure about whom little is known. The prophet Daniel is another central figure in the Islamic geomantic and astrological traditions.[^9] He also occurs as a principal authority in a Garshūnī manuscript of the *Madākhil ʿilm al-raml* from the Bibliothèque nationale de France and in one of the Mardin codices mentioned above.[^10]


Nothing is known about the scribes of these particular manuscripts, and neither the Mardin nor the Paris witnesses are dated (though based on palaeographical evidence, an eighteenth-century date is likely). However, the occurrence of these works in Christian collections suggests a broader appeal of what is commonly assumed to be an Islamic occult science. It has been suggested by scholars that Garshūnī was used by Arabic-speaking Christians as a mark of confessional identity—a strategy that restricted certain texts to an internal audience.[^11] While this might be true in a certain number of cases, Garshūnī-writing also produced works that resonated beyond confessional lines.[^12] Geomancy, it seems, was no exception.

## Arabic Alchemy in Syriac Christian Communities

What can the paratextual features of these manuscripts tells us about their owners? Turning now to the subject of alchemy, we encounter instances of two worlds coming together in seemingly incongruous ways. In a compendium of Arabic alchemical texts from Istanbul, we find a Syriac homily penned at the end of an Arabic-script copy of Ps.-Majrīṭī's *Kitāb al-Rutba*, a treatise on the decipherment of alchemical codes (*rumūz*).[^13] The homily is by the late-antique theologian Jacob of Serugh (d. 521) and is about Ezekiel's vision of the chariot. Given the use of the *serṭō* script, it is likely that the manuscript was once owned and read by Syrian Orthodox or Maronite Christians. But why scribble a Christian theological poem on the margins of an Arabic work on alchemy attributed to a medieval Muslim author? The reasons are unclear, but it is interesting to note that the homily occurs close to where the body text mentions that 


> when the scholar investigates the foundation of the \[alchemical\] art
> (*al-ṣanʿa*), from whatever and wherever it ought to be, he finds in
> his solution that it was \[given\] by God (mighty and majestic) to His
> prophets, saints, righteous ones, and sages from every nation (*min*
> *kull milla*) whose religion, piety, and asceticism (*al-zuhd fī*
> *l-dunyā*) He approved. For God (mighty and majestic) gave it to Adam
> for mankind as recompense for expelling him from Paradise (*ʿiwaḍan*
> *ʿan jannatihi allatī akhrajahu minhā*).[^14]


Perhaps after reading this statement about alchemy as a universal science, the scribe was reminded of the following verses from Jacob's homily:


> Each man with his face set toward his place to preach the Gospel
> and with Simon's confession they hasten and do not swerve:
> Thomas in India and Addai in Mesopotamia, Matthew in Judah and Paul 
> among the nations of the earth.[^15]


It is also likely that the homily was written down as a pen trial. Whatever the precise reasons, we later encounter a more direct interaction between the Syriac Christian reader and the Arabic text of the same manuscript. In the middle of an alchemical treatise by the Mamluk alchemist ʿIzz al-Dīn Aydamir b. ʿAlī al-Jildakī (fl. ninth/fourteenth c.), the writing suddenly shifts from Arabic to Garshūnī, likely to replace missing folios, since the writing later reverts to Arabic.[^16]

But how did Arabic-speaking Christians interact with the occult sciences beyond reading and copying texts? As we have already noted, these manuscripts are often undated and difficult to contextualise. Nevertheless, in many early modern Garshūnī manuscripts, we find suggestions that Christians in Ottoman lands possessed a working of knowledge of alchemy, in addition to being interested readers of alchemical treatises. This is evident from the manuscript tradition of an alchemical text known as the *Risālat Arisṭāṭālīs al-faylasūf ilā al-Iskandar fī l-ṣināʿa* (henceforth *Risāla*), a systematic treatise on the making of the elixir framed as an epistolary exchange between Alexander the Great and his teacher Aristotle.[^17] These two figures loomed large in both the Muslim and Christian imaginaries of the medieval and early modern world.[^18] Yet despite some of the *Risāla*'s Christian associations (the author claims to have translated it from Syriac), much of the work's alchemical principles and operations are traceable to medieval Muslim writers such as Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (d. ca. 200/815?) and Abū Bakr al-Rāzī (d. 313 or 323/ 925 or 935).[^19] The extant manuscripts of the *Risāla* itself are equally distributed between Garshūnī and Arabic script witnesses. The former were clearly read in Christian—mainly Syrian Orthodox and Maronite—circles, while the latter are found across Muslim collections from North Africa to northern India.[^20] As such, the text had a wide circulation not only geographically but also confessionally, spanning religions and even scripts.


Of particular interest to us is that the *Risāla* consciously avoids alchemical codes, or *Decknamen*. Instead, the principles of the "Noble Art" are laid out in relatively clear terms. There is one exception, however. In his letter to Alexander, Aristotle informs his pupil: 


> We have disclosed it (i.e. alchemy) to you and have not concealed
> \[anything\] from you in this epistle other than the measures of
> balances concerning the composition of the three pillars (*al-arkān*
> *al-thalātha*). We will symbolise these with what leads you to
> knowledge of them, which is by squaring a scalene triangle (*tarbīʿ*
> *al-muthallath al-mukhtalif al-aḍlāʿ*), according to the geometricians.
> We have only done so for fear that, in times to come, this epistle
> will fall into the hands of someone other than you, someone
> undeserving.[^21]


Aristotle's statement is somewhat opaque. However, in the margins of one of the Garshūnī manuscript from Mardin (CFMM 554), we find an illustration left by the scribe that hints at the meaning of the "squaring of the scalene triangle". The triangle contains the following in Syriac on each of its sides: *faghrō* ("body") followed by the number twenty; *nafshō* ("soul") followed by the number fifteen; and *rūḥō* ("spirit") followed by the number five.[^22] Alluded to by the scribe is a principle that was well-known in Jābirian alchemy. The variable numbers on the side of the triangle represent the differing potencies of the three metallic principles: the body is thick and course; the spirit makes the body fine and subtle; and the soul possesses a potency that lies somewhere in between.[^23] The diagram may have been the scribe's way of making sense of this passage, but it also evidences a deeper knowledge of the tradition. Indeed, the triangular visualisation of the body, soul, and spirit is common throughout several Arabic alchemical manuscripts.[^24]

We find further evidence of an active engagement with alchemy among Arabic-speaking elsewhere in CFMM 554. Before and after the pseudo-Aristotelian *Risāla*, there are several alchemical recipes scattered throughout the manuscript, both in Garshūnī and the Arabic script. These include directions for the making of soap, "gold clay", and the purification of lead carbonate. The quality of the scribe's handwriting in these recipes is drastically different compared to that of the manuscript's systematic treatises, perhaps reflecting differences between literary composition and more ephemeral kinds of writing.[^25] It should be noted that similar recipes have been uncovered in other non-Muslim archives, namely the Cairo Geniza written in Judeo-Arabic.[^26] Such texts give us valuable insights into the practical as well as literary side of alchemy among Arabic-speaking non-Muslims.


As we have seen so far, the manuscript tradition of the *Risāla* speaks of a transconfessional alchemical science, united in the Arabic language but set apart in script. As one might expect, these manuscripts were also set apart by social context. This is vividly illustrated in two further manuscripts of the *Risāla*. The first is the only dated witness to the text, a Vatican codex copied in Rome in 1654 by a Maronite deacon named Yūsuf al-Hilāl al-Baslūqītī.[^27] Known in Europe as Joseph Luna (the Latinised form of his name), al-Baslūqītī worked as a printer at the Propaganda Fide in Rome, where Maronites from Mount Lebanon—many of whom had previous training as scribes—found employment as translators, Arabic teachers, and copy editors.[^28] Other than his Garshūnī colophon, we know little about the circumstances surrounding al-Baslūqītī's copying of this alchemical work. The second exemplar of the *Risāla* is in the *nastaʿlīq* script and was once owned by a Muslim. We can be sure of the owner's religious identity from an ex libris by a scribe or notary, which reads: *istaṣḥabahu al-faqīr Muḥammad Rāshid kātib dīwān humayun*.[^29] Given the eighteenth-century handwriting, it is likely that the person named in this note was Meḥmed Rāşid Efendī (d. 1212/1798), a notary (*dīvān kātibī*) at the Ottoman Imperial Council (*dīvān-ı hümāyūn*) in Istanbul and later head clerk (*Reʾīsü\'l-küttāb*).[^30] The backgrounds of these two manuscripts, therefore, speak of a rich and varied reception of the *Risāla*, read and copied as it was by a Maronite deacon in Rome and an Ottoman bureaucrat in Istanbul.


Often when we discuss Christian geomancy, alchemy, and similar topics, we tend to think of medieval and Renaissance Europe. The migration of occult knowledge from the Islamic world to the Latin West has been a subject of growing interest among scholars. But far less understood is how Christian communities in the Middle East thought about and practiced these same sciences. By studying manuscripts, we gain valuable insights into how occult figures and motifs were common property to both Muslims and Christians living in close proximity. Though separated by religion, and sometimes even script, both contexts were brought together by a shared interest in the occult sciences—sciences that might justifiably be called "Islamicate."

[Salam Rassi](https://www.history.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-salam-rassi?filter_types-3093986%5b%5d=&filter_series-3093986%5b%5d=) is a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Oxford and has held teaching and research positions at the American University of Beirut and the Hill Museum and Manuscript Library. His primary interest is in religious, philosophical, and scientific encounters between Christians and Muslims in the Middle Ages. His first book—entitled *Christian Thought in the Medieval Islamicate World: Abdisho of Nisibis and the Apologetic Tradition*—was published by Oxford University Press in 2021. His current research focuses on two interconnected areas: (i) the history of theological and philosophical encyclopaedism among Syriac and Arabic-speaking Christians and (ii) the Syriac reception of Avicennan philosophy. A further project involves the history of Islamicate alchemy. Much of this work centres on an unedited alchemical primer attributed to Aristotle, on which he has a 65-page article in *Asiatische Studien* and a critical edition and translation in progress.
